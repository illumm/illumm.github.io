The 1929 stock market crash went on for the first six months following the inauguration of President Herbert Hoover in January 1929. The prices of stocks raised to raging heights in the Hoover bull market. Many people started investing in securities after the crash.

A crash today would cause economic collapse worldwide. Since the end of World War II, there have been 12 official recessions in the US. Eight of them were preceded by bear markets, and 3 by a market correction. As the coronovirus pandemic begin to shut down the US in March 2020, the markets crashed. The stock market crash of 2020 disrupted a ten-year, all-time high bull market. However, the Black Tuesday crash remains the worst stock market crash in US history.
