Inflation is the increase in the overall price of goods and services in the economy over time. The Federal Reserve is reducing its interest rate target due to the recent inflation surge. Consumers expect inflation to be high in the next year, but expect a lower rate in five to 10 years. Based on recent changes in the break-even inflation rate, bond investors aren't betting on inflation rising.

The US target inflation rate is 2%, but the average rate of inlfation is currently 3.1%. The medical inflation rate was at 4.11% in 2020. The food inflation rate came down to 2.4%. The GDP growth rate for Q1 2021 was 6.4%, and, overall, the US headline rate of inflation varied from 0.1% to 2.3% in 2020.
