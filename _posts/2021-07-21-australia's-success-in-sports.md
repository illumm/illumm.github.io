Australian sports teams have won countless titles and a huge contributor to their success is their extensive and expensive medical research. The Austrialian Sports Commission (ASC) finances programs for countless sports. Both novice and pro athletes live at the Australian Insitute of Sport (AIS) where they are monitored closesly by coaches.

Along with tools that improve training, scientists from the AIS and Cooperative Research Centre for Micro Technology in Melbourne are currently developing sensors that will be embedded in athletes' clothing to monitor heart rate, sweating, and heat production. Australian coaches utilize 3D analysis tools as well as SWAN (Swimming Analysis). The SWAN can be used to collect images from cameras so that each part of the swimmer's technique, such as stroke length, is observed individually. Every movement of the athlete is closely monitored and stored. The data is crucial in terms of improving athletes' performance. The improvement is unique to every individual in the sport.
