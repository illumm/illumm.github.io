The stock market is responsible to provide a venue for investors to buy and sell individual company shares, funds or other financial products. Stock market exchanges are private businesses that assist in financial transactions. Nowadays, most exchanges are fully electronic and receive inbound orders from broker dealers whose clients want to buy and sell shares.

When it comes to investing, risk can be broadly defined as the probability of increasing or decreasing capital. A portfolio is the collection of investments that one owns. Stocks are the riskiest type of investments because outside factors of the investor's control influence their price and performance.

The stock market being up or down refers to market indexes, which tracks the performance of a group of stocks. Stock trading is associated with buying and selling stocks frequently to correctly time the market. Investors dedicate hours a day to research the market.

A bear market occurs when stock prices are falling. A bull market, when investors are confident, indicates growth. Bull markets tend to come right after bear markets.
