Economics is the understanding of how money (or wealth) is made, used, and shared. It is a social science (Britannica). Economics involves studying and thinking about how people treat wealth and businesses, how best to gain wealth, and what data can help make predictions (American Economic Association). Economists include anyone who uses their understanding of people, money, and business to help their team (American Economic Association). Studying the economy lets people see how different divisions and drivers of the economy connect and influence each other, sometimes unintentionally (Khan Academy).

## Types of Economics

- Microeconomics: people use economics/the economy for self-gain (Khan Academy)
  - Supporting ideology: Capitalism (free economy)
  - Used for companies, investors, etc.
- Macroeconomics: people use economics to better society as a whole (Khan Academy)
  - Supporting ideology: Marxism (equal economy)
  - Government spending/taxing, policies, NPOs, etc.

“An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible.”
Alfred A. Knof
