      <p>We want to shine a light on those who do not have access to educational resources. When the pandemic became a major part of our lives, we realized that several other major components of life like education. The struggle that several families initially went through was now on a whole other level. The bridge between the privileged and underprivileged widened. We as illumm hope to narrow this gap by providing resources such as webinars, competitions, workshops, and other extracurricular resources to students. We want to play a part in the bright futures of talented young minds.</p>
